<!-- 
# Configuration file for libinput-gestures.
#
# The default configuration file exists at /etc/libinput-gestures.conf
# but a user can create a personal custom configuration file at
# ~/.config/libinput-gestures.conf.
#
# Currently "application", "gesture", "command" and "device" configuration tags are supported as
# described below.
# Each gesture tag has 2-4 attributes:
#
# type, motion, [fingers] and [description]
#
# where type and motion is either:
#     swipe up|down|left|right|left_up|right_up|left_down|right_down
#     pinch in|out|clockwise|anticlockwise
#	  pointer tap|double_tap|triple_tap|quadruple_tap
#
# command is the child tag of the gesture and is any valid shell command + arguments.
#
# fingers is a single numeric digit and is optional (and is
# typically 3 or 4). If specified then the command is executed when
# exactly that number of fingers is used in the gesture. If not
# specified then the command is executed when that gesture is executed
# with any number of fingers. Gesture lines specified with finger_count
# have priority over the same gesture specified without any
# finger_count.
#
# Typically command will be xdotool, or wmctrl. See "man xdotool" for
# the many things you can action with that tool. Note that unfortunately
# xdotool does not work with native Wayland clients.
